The students did an excellent mock viva in general. The presentation introduces in detail about the extent to which the tasks and goals outlined in the work-plan were finished.

It reviewed the related literature and proposed the questions to answer. The issues were solved using reasonable methods and the findings are grounded in solid evidence. The student is honest about the shortcomings of this paper.

It would be nice for the student to demonstrate the related implementations with functional software or webpage.

If there is anything to be improved, I think the student need focus on one or two major issues that have been solved by this thesis and introduces the results of experiments or simulation.
